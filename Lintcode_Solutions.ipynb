        "我们建立一个累加和数组sums，然后求出原数组中最小值赋给left，最大值赋给right，题目中说了误差是1e-5，所以我们的循环条件就是right比left大1e-5，然后我们算出来mid，定义一个minSum初始化为0，布尔型变量check，初始化为false。然后开始遍历数组，先更新累加和数组sums，注意这个累加和数组不是原始数字的累加，而是它们和mid相减的差值累加。我们的目标是找长度大于等于k的子数组的平均值大于mid，由于我们每个数组都减去了mid，那么就转换为找长度大于等于k的子数组的差累积值大于0。我们建立差值累加数组的意义就在于通过sums[i] - sums[j]来快速算出j和i位置中间数字之和，那么我们只要j和i中间正好差k个数字即可，然后minSum就是用来保存j位置之前的子数组差累积的最小值，所以当i >= k时，我们用sums[i - k]来更新minSum，这里的i - k就是j的位置，然后判断如果sums[i] - minSum > 0了，说明我们找到了一段长度大于等k的子数组平均值大于mid了，就可以更新left为mid了，我们标记check为true，并退出循环。在for循环外面，当check为true的时候，left更新为mid，否则right更新为mid，参见代码如下："
